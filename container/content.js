            <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
            <p>India lies within the Indomalaya ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots.
            One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 
            6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's 
            landmass is covered by forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests 
            (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests.<br/><br/>
            Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous 
            forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak 
            forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.
            The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree.
            The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.
